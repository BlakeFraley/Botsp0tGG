# Botsp0tGG
Botsp0tGG is a music bot I created for my buddy Jet's stream Discord server.
It also might make an appearance on some other servers that me, Jet, and our friends use while playing games. 
Features will probably start with bare simplicities with more being added as I spend more time with it.
Botsp0tGG is being written in JavaScript using Node.js.
Thanks for giving it a shot!
